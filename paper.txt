# Zero-shot Recognition via Semantic Embeddings and Knowledge Graphs
## Introduction
### Problem
- **zero-shot recognition**: learning a visual classiﬁer for a category with zero training examples, just using the word embedding of the category and its relationship to other categories
- Explanation: current recognition algorithms can only recognize the categories they are trained with. Adding a new category requires collecting thousands of training examples and then retraining the classiﬁers
- Objective:  transfer knowledge obtained from familiar classes to describe the unfamiliar classes (generalization)

## Graph Convolutional Network
- Procedures: Word Embedding with word2vec; Build Knowledge Graph; Graph Convolutional Network Layer (convolved by knowledge graph); train classifier and use true classifier as supervisor
